# tmp-stream

utility to handle temporary file streams and such FUN small module good time

I should make this readme.md more serious....


getStat: writes to a tmp file, gets the stat object, and then wipes the tmp file.
for getting sizes of streams/files/blob things before sending to S3 and such

randomPath: gives you a random path in current working directory to write to
